# MeshSplitting
This is the source code and a simplified version of the demo from my master thesis in "Procedural Mesh Splitting". 
The thesis was writtin in 2012 and was developed using unity, but the theory could be applied to any engine.

**Demo Controls**<br/>
To slice hold down Space, then press down left mouse button, drag your slicing line, and release the button.
* WASD - Move
* Mouse - Look
* Space - Freeze movement and prepare slice.
* LMB and Mouse drag - Slice
* 1-5 - Spawn new object and clean up old pieces. (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Table, Melon)
* Q/E - Switch Material
